# VIKOpti

VIKOpti is an open-source python project for design optimization using an efficient genetic algorithm with some cool features, inspired by the optimization process described in [M. Hall. (2012)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1304.0751).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Python](https://www.python.org/)
- [Scipy](https://scipy.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

### Installation

First, clone or download the project repository and go to its directory:

```console
git clone https://github.com/vbenifla/VIKOpti.git
